Kubernetes, or k8s for short, is a system for automating application deployment. Modern applications are dispersed across clouds, virtual machines, and servers. Administering apps manually is no longer a viable option.

K8s transforms virtual and physical machines into a unified API surface. A developer can then use the Kubernetes API to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications.

Its architecture also provides a flexible framework for distributed systems. K8s automatically orchestrates scaling and failovers for your applications and provides deployment patterns.

It helps manage containers that run the applications and ensures there is no downtime in a production environment. For example, if a container goes down, another container automatically takes its place without the end-user ever noticing.

Kubernetes is not only an orchestration system. It is a set of independent, interconnected control processes. Its role is to continuously work on the current state and move the processes in the desired direction.
